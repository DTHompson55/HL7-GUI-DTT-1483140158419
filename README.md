# Node.js HL7 Test Harness

HL7 Test Harness pushes HL7 content to an IIB implementated SOAP service
It has ability to choose several ORM and ORU documents and send them.
In the current release you can upload new HL7 documents, but you do anything with them yet.

Future planes:
 - finish
  - fileupload renaming
  - fileupload redirection back to index.html
  - show the new files that have been uploaded
  - be able save edits to HL7 files to a new name.
  - listen for async results from IIB and post them to the UI
